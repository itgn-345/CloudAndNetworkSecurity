## Background

This weekâ€™s theme focuses on cloud security.

Cloud security refers to the set of practices, technologies, and policies designed to protect data, applications, and infrastructure hosted in cloud environments. With the widespread adoption of cloud computing, ensuring the security of cloud-based resources has become paramount for organizations of all sizes.

Key aspects of cloud security include:

1) Authentication and Access Control: Cloud security protocols implement mechanisms to verify the identity of users and devices accessing cloud services. This involves employing strong authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enforcing granular access controls to restrict privileges based on user roles and responsibilities.

2) Data Encryption: Encrypting data both in transit and at rest is essential for safeguarding sensitive information stored in the cloud. Encryption algorithms are utilized to encode data, ensuring that even if intercepted, it remains unintelligible to unauthorized parties.

3) Compliance and Regulatory Requirements: Cloud security measures must align with industry-specific regulations and compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. Adhering to these standards helps ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data stored in the cloud while mitigating legal and financial risks.

4) Threat Detection and Incident Response: Cloud security protocols employ advanced monitoring and threat detection tools to identify suspicious activities and potential security breaches in real-time. Prompt incident response strategies are implemented to mitigate the impact of security incidents and restore normal operations swiftly.

5) Infrastructure Protection: Securing the underlying infrastructure of cloud platforms is crucial for preventing unauthorized access and data breaches. This involves implementing firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), and security patches to fortify cloud-based servers, networks, and storage resources.

Common cloud security technologies and protocols include Identity and Access Management (IAM), Transport Layer Security (TLS), Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

## Task 2
>[!Note]
> Create Short introduction on environment variables & cloud development

This task involves intentionally vulnerable Kubernetes deployments and services that you are to exploit using multitude of tools such as Fluff and a tool to access the database from outside the Kubernetes cluster. The idea is to get deeper and deeper into the system as you progress through the stages and use the information found during the task to find different flags. This task can be completed on both Linux and Windows machines, but it is easier to use the tools with an UNIX operating system, and there is a shell scripts for creating the environment in bash. You can use any tool of your choise for managing the Kubernetes cluster, but the course staff recommends using Kind for this as it is what the task is developed with. 

You can read more about the tools used during this task at:
* **Kind**
* **Helm**
* **Fuff**

### Deploying the laboratory environment
First make sure that you have installed Docker, Helm and Go on your machine. Make also sure to have your Docker engine or Docker desktop running.
Then you can run the following command to install Kind:
```bash
go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.22.0
```
After you have successfully installed the forementioned software, you can then run the:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```
script from the CloudAndNetworkSecurity/5. Cloud Security/ directory to deploy all the Kubernetes resources.
Wait for the Kubernetes pods to be in Running and READY states, this should take a couple minutes maximum, you can monitor this with:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
When you have all the pods in a **Running** and **READY X/X** states, you can then use the following script to portforward the necessary resources for access on the 127.0.0.1:
```bash
./access.sh
```
Confirm that you can access the url: http://localhost:1230
If you managed to access the url, then you have successfully deployed the laboratory environment! :boom:

>[!Note]
> You can delete all the resources by the command running "kind delete cluster --name kind-cloudsec"

### Finding hidden endpoints
There are some hidden endpoints in the web application, your first task is to find these endpoints. You can use Fuff or gobuster for finding these endpoints. The course staff has provided you a wordlist for using these tools in this repository. 

Documentate how many endpoints you found and describe if there is anything interesting in those endpoints and if they could be potentially exploited.

### Getting access to the database
You should have found an endpoint that points to a database and another that lists the internal filesystem of the pod running the web application, but it seems there is some files hidden when accessing the endpoint directly via the front end. Your next task is to find environment variables from the filesystem that could be used to access the database endpoint, one instance in the database contains a flag.

You should find two flags during this process. Document your process and include the flags.

### Accessing the database with superuser credentials from remote
It seems you have gained access to one table in the database that the frontend points to previously, now your task is to access the database with the admin credentials from outside the Kubernetes cluster. For this you need to find a suitable client to connect into the database, you can extract more information about the database with the kubectl commands to figure out which kind of client you need for this.

Provide the command you used to access the database from outside the Kubernetes cluster and the flag that is found in another table in the database.

## Task 3

### Perform Kubernetes Goat tutorials

In this task, you'll complete three Kubernetes Goat tutorials and answer key questions. 

As stated on the official website: "Kubernetes Goat is an interactive Kubernetes security learning playground. It has intentionally vulnerable by design scenarios to showcase the common misconfigurations, real-world vulnerabilities, and security issues in Kubernetes clusters, containers, and cloud native environments."

Useful resources:
1. Main website of Kubernetes Goat. Click [here](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/docs/)
2. Github of Kubernetes Goat. Click [here](https://github.com/madhuakula/kubernetes-goat)

>[!Important]
> You'll use the deployment from task 2 to complete these tutorials.
> Provided tutorials are one way to complete the tasks. You can try different approaches and commands too.

### A) Perform tutorial: SSRF in the Kubernetes (K8S) world
