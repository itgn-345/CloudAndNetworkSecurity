## Practicalities

The course has seven laboratory exercises

Lectures are handling topics from a high perspective.

Laboratory exercises are thought of as independent packages: containing theory and exercises and going technologically very deep.

To pass this course with grade 1, you have to attend all lectures including the five physical lectures. Failing to do so results in a written exam based on the lectures missed.

To get a better grade, you have to do some laboratory exercises. All laboratory tasks are optional and total points from those will determine your grade.

## Grading

As described earlier, you have to attend all lectures to pass the course. You can have higher grades by doing lab work.

You can get up to 5 points in each lab (A total of 35 points). The grade is determined based on those points. For example, with 9 points you get grade 2.

Total Points|Total Grade
:-:|:-:
9+ | 2
15+ | 3
21+ | 4
27+ | 5
