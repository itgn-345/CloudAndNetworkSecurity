Cloud and Network Security Lab 3: Network Protocols
====

Responsible person/main contact: Niklas Saari, Asad Hasan & Lauri Suutari

## Preliminary tasks & prerequisites

This is the third lab in the series with the theme of Network Protocols. 
You should return the tasks to GitHub.

Make yourself familiar with the following topics:


* **List of networking protocols** - Read about the list of networking protocols for the OSI model on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_network_protocols_(OSI_model))
* **20 common networking protocols** - Article presenting 20 common networking protocols [here](https://medium.com/@rajeshmamuddu/20-different-network-protocols-commonly-used-in-networking-e98cab90d18d)
* **OSI Model** - What is the OSI Model on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
* Especially, [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is the topic of this week!

TLS protocol from a cryptographic perspective is handled in more depth in cryptographic systems and weakness - course.
This time we note the challenges of the practical implementation, which might not be related to cryptography itself.


## Grading

<!-- <details><summary>Details</summary> -->

You are **not required** to do the tasks in order, but if you do the second task, you shouldn't do the task 3 or 4.

As a result, there are two different paths to do the exercises this week.
 * In both cases, you can do the task 1, and then
    * Do task 2 completely and ignore the rest. With very good implementation you might get even more than 6 points.
    * Or, do the tasks 3 and 4, but not that many points are available. Task 2 covers also the topics of tasks 3 and 4.



Task #|Points|Description|Tools
-----|:---:|-----------|-----
Task 1 | 1 | HTTP request smuggling | TBD
Task 2 | 6 | Implementing TLS 1.3 client from scratch | Rust or programming language of your choice, Wireshark, libFuzzer, libAFL
Task 3 | 1 | Fuzz testing exising network protocol (TLS library, Wireshark) (alternative to task 2 with less points) | AFL++, radamsa, other fuzzing tools
Task 4 | 1 | TLS certificate validation | certmitm, mitmproxy, Wireshark


Total points accumulated by doing the exercises reflect the overall grade. You can acquire up to 5 points from the whole exercise.

## About the lab

* This document contains task descriptions and theory for the third cloud and network security lab. If there are any differences between the return template and this file, consider this to be the up-to-date document.
* **You are encouraged to use your own computer or virtual machine if you want.** TODO ----------------------- TODO
* Check the deadline from Moodle and __remember that you have to return your name (and possibly people you worked together with) and GitHub repository information to Moodle before the deadline.__


## Background

This weekâ€™s theme is networking protocols.

Tasks are designed to be done using the course's provided virtual machine. **TODO**

Networking protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication between devices in a computer network. These protocols define how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and interpreted across the network. They facilitate the exchange of information between devices, ensuring compatibility and interoperability.

Key aspects of networking protocols include:

1) Addressing: Protocols define how devices are identified and addressed on the network. This includes assigning unique addresses, such as IP addresses, to devices to enable communication.

2) Routing: Protocols determine how data packets are routed from a source to a destination across the network. This involves selecting the best path for data transmission and managing network congestion.

3) Error Handling: Protocols include mechanisms for detecting and correcting errors that may occur during data transmission. This ensures reliable communication between devices.

4) Security: Many protocols incorporate security features to protect data from unauthorized access, interception, or tampering. This includes encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms.

Some common examples of networking protcols include: Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

## Task 2: Implementing TLS 1.3 client from scratch (up to 6 points)

> [!Note]
> You can complete this task in pairs! **But not in larger groups**. The workload assumes that you have friendly LLMs available, such as ChatGPT, [Phind](https://www.phind.com) or [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart).

> You can fully focus on this task to get up to 6 points by doing it carefully. But be warned, getting a maximum grade requires a lot of work.

> If you want to skip the coding, you have another path with similar goal. You can fuzz test existing TLS library and get up to 1 points. Additionally, there is an additional certificate validation task which replaces the same part of this task. As result, this offers two points.


Implementing network protocols correctly can be *hard*. They are typically complex and work in a binary, non-text format.
This is because of the performance reasons, error correction and the minimized addition of overhead to the total bandwidth usage. They must follow strict standards to be compatible with different hardware and software systems.
Protocols must be designed to handle arbitrary data and then parse and process them correctly while doing it fast. They must be fault-tolerant if they encounter incorrect data.

If we look at the network OSI model structure, we can see many different protocols on different layers for different purposes. 
In the following example graph, the application is transmitting ASN.1 binary encoded data as TLS 1.3 encrypted over TCP/IP protocol. 

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Application Layer] -->|"Data Encoding (ASN.1 binary)"| B[Presentation Layer]
    B -->|TLS 1.3| C["Session Layer"]
    C -->|TCP/IP| D[Transport Layer]
    D --> E[Network Layer]
    E --> F[Data Link Layer]
    F --> G[Physical Layer]
```

All of the protocols are complex, but they share similar efficiency and robustness requirements while having different goals. 
 
 * ASN.1 encodes the application-specific data compactly to be suitable for the usage and parsing of other applications. (Compare it to more efficient  JSON)
 * TLS 1.3. encrypts the session data so that it cannot be eavesdropped on or modified, while also giving sufficient guarantees that the data goes to the intended party.
 * TCP/IP carries the data to the destination over some network in an IP address space with some reliability guarantees.


To demonstrate the complexity and process of doing them correctly and *maybe even more securely*, we will implement the handshake part of the TLS 1.3 protocol standard as a minimal client.

This should also make you more familiar with what it takes to transmit encrypted data over an insecure line so that it might even go to the correct destination, efficiently with binary protocols.

> [!Important]
> **This is for educational purposes only. In general, you should not write your TLS library yourself on byte level.**

### TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol

* [RFC 8446](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446)
    * Provided ASN.1 notations about data structures are super useful when implementing the client. Especially, if one consults a friendly LLM. The Rust starter project has already most of them.
    * You *will need to* read this standard to understand the protocol.

* Transport Layer Security [in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)


A small background [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3) about the major changes compared to previous versions.

In conclusion, TLS 1.3 is much simpler compared to previous versions and supports only a limited amount of cipher suites (only the strong ones).

For the purpose of this task, it should be doable, and can give us a glance at what protocols could be!


Your main guide source should be the standard and [https://tls13.xargs.org](https://tls13.xargs.org).
The provided Rust project will help the implementation of other programming languages too, if you decide so. 

During the handshake, both the client and server agree on the cipher suite as follows.

* Key exchange mechanism (e.g., ECDHE for elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman ephemeral)
* Signature algorithm (e.g., RSA, ECDSA)
* Symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
* The hash function for message authentication and PRFs (e.g., SHA-256)

The priority of the cipher suites is pre-defined for the task.

### Implementation requirements

> [!Important]
> You should implement *a client*, with minimal working features to complete TLS 1.3 handshake, while also noting the error handling. Or more, if you decide so, to replace other tasks from this week.

Minimal TLS client implementation includes the completion of the handshake process with the following features:
  * Key exchange with X25519 and signatures with EdDSA (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519 and Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm based on the same curve).
  * ChaCha20-Poly1305 as a symmetric algorithm.
  * The client should be able to handle the processing of arbitrary input data from the TCP stream.
  *  In TLS 1.3, the use of certain extensions is mandatory
  * Mandatory extensions as specified [here.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#section-9.2) The sample Rust project has most of them implemented with `as_bytes` mapper. The extensions required are
    * Supported Versions (describes the used TLS version)
    * Server Name (What is the DNS of the server we want to connect)
    * Signature Algorithms (What method to use to sign the data)
    * Supported Groups (Key negotiation algorithm)
    * Key Share (Public keys)
  * At least `cloudflare.com` supports the above ciphers for testing purposes.
  * You can and *should* use Wireshark to debug your implementation.

Note that the protocol follows mostly the *tag-length-value* principle. 
There can be constraints for the size of the tag or length, and **this defines how many bytes the tag or length can take**, while the length itself then defines the number of subsequent bytes.

The sample project provides the *encoding* part for the above, but not the *decoding* part. Decoding means mapping arbitrary binary data to correct data structures. This the part where the typical security problems arise.


Additional requirements: 
 * Proper client-side certificate validation (replace the additional certificate validation task with this) (1p)

**One extra point** on showcasing the decrypted TLS 1.3 application data from the server that supports this client.
    * In practice, you send TLS 1.3 encrypted application data, for example to `cloudflare.com`. The application data contains 


> You are alloved to consult a friendly LLM, but note that the code it provides might not be correct and can include bugs! You are not allowed to directly copy-paste some existing implementation, even though the LLM is likely providing code samples based on those.


You must implement it with a strongly typed programming language of your choice.

Generally, if you want to do something efficiently, you should pick a lower-level programming language.
Typically, this has meant either the use of C or C++.
However, with great power comes a great responsibility and the history is filled with memory safety issues. Correct programming is hard and making difficult protocols makes it even harder. 

**You will get one bonus point for doing the work with *Rust*; this encourages the usage of memory-safe language, which can produce native performance and it enforces other design choices that could reduce the bugs in the software.**

> [!Note]
> *If you end up fighting with the Rust compiler, you are just preventing bugs, which would have resulted into software runtime with another programming language!*

Overall grading table for this task:

Description |Points|
-----|:---:|
Use of Rust with sufficient implementation | 1 |
Minimal handshake implementation from above | 2 |
Fuzz testing the implementation with the help of fuzzing libraries | 1 |
Proper client-side certificate validation | 1 |
Decrypt application content from TLS 1.3 server with your client | 1 |


### Language list that you should consider

1. Rust (1 bonus point from sufficient implementation, and we offer [a starter project](rust_example), with a lot of working functionality, to compensate for the initial difficulty of the language.)
2. Other strongly typed memory-safe languages (typically less efficient because of the dynamic memory management) (Swift ([ARC-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Reference_Counting)), Go, Java, C#, etc.)
3. Programming C++ with [modern features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp?view=msvc-170) (Unique pointers etc.), [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), or other native languages with some memory safety properties. High performance and control-level with some risk of memory issues.
4. Weakly typed scripting languages (Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript) or risky languages, C, basic C++, and Assembly, **are not allowed this time**. While the scripting languages can provide memory-safe code, they are typically inefficient, and increase the likelihood of other bugs as a result of weak types. 


For Rust, check [the starter project](rust_example).

If you decide to use C++, **you must use modern pointers**. We don't like memory bugs.
The use of modern pointers does not guarantee it, but they reduce them significantly.
They apply a similar ownership principle as the Rust does for every data object by default.

### Software dependency requirements

You are allowed to use dependencies other than the programming language's standard library as follows if they are not included in the standard library:
 * To generate cryptographically secure random bits. (e.g. [rand](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/) crate in Rust)
 * To derive the public key from the private key in X25519 protocol (e.g. [curve25519-dalek ](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/tree/main/x25519-dalek) crate in Rust) and calculate the shared secret.
 * For parsing the certificates (typically means ASN.1 DER encoding), e.g. [rasn](https://github.com/librasn/rasn) crate in Rust. 
 * For ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption and EdDSA signatures

 Other dependencies **are not allowed**.

## Debugging tips for the handshake protocol

You can use `openssl` to form a TLS connection with specific parameters.
This can help us to understand, what the correct process looks like, on top of the other material.
Let's say, we want to force TLS 1.3 version and get the handshake data. We can use the following command:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect cloudflare.com:443 -tls1_3 -ciphersuites TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 -msg -tlsextdebug
```

However, not all the data is well segmented.
The content of `ClientHello` is a single hex dump, and that does not help us to see, for example, what extensions our client sets by default.

For that, Wireshark is very useful. It can format every byte from the TLS handshake protocol and can help us to get, for example, test data from known functioning TLS libraries, or **it can help us to understand what goes wrong with our own TLS implementation**.

Here is an example look for TLS 1.3 ClientHello structure for `github.com` in Wireshark:

Wireshark is capable of showing what specific part from the `ClientHello` structure was invalid.

## Task 3

## Task 4 TLS certificate validation
> [!Note]
> If you completed the client-side implementation to a sufficient level in task 2, you do not need to complete this task to receive full credits for this weeks laboratory.

Certificate validation is an ongoing problem with TLS implementations, lots of libraries implement this, but the issue is that certificate validation is usually optional for the client in TLS and the configuration of certificate validation in different TLS libraries can be very difficult. When validating certificates, it should be checked who has issued the certificate, to whom is it issued to and that the certificate has been properly signed. Especially self signed certificates should not just be accepted without validation as these can be easily created on the go. A good example of improper certificate validations are [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) and [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/) libraries where the validation isn't even enabled by default.

To complete this task you should understand how TLS works and how the certificates are (or aren't) validated on the server side. The following links contain sufficient information to get started with this task:
* [DEF CON 31 - certmitm Automatic Exploitation of TLS Certificate Validation Vulns - Aapo Oksman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_l2q_Gyqfo)
* [Presentation slides of certmitm](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2031/DEF%20CON%2031%20presentations/Aapo%20Oksman%20-%20certmitm%20automatic%20exploitation%20of%20TLS%20certificate%20validation%20vulnerabilities.pdf)
* [Exploiting insecure Certificate Validation in iOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWidokJKuUc)
* [certmitm demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0HeTBfKLhQ)

You are free to use **tools of your choice** to complete this task, however we highly suggest getting started with Aapo Oksman's [certmitm](https://github.com/aapooksman/certmitm) tool. For full credit you should demonstrate the usage of your tool of choice on **multiple different application types** such as; mobile applications, web applications, games and/or other software to see if they are implementing certificate validation properly. You should create/acquire different kind of certificates to test with such as: self-signed certificates, real certificates with replaced keys and CA issued certificates. It is important to note that there is no one right way to complete this task, you could for example route your browser traffic through the proxy or use your laptop as a hotspot that routes mobile devices traffic through the proxy. Sometimes the best thing you can do after a failed certificate validation is to retry a couple times to see if you can get further.

The overall process should look like the following:
1. Acquire/create certificates
2. Run a proxy to intercept TLS connections
3. Connect clients through the proxy
4. Use a tool to test if the certificates get validated 
5. Report your results
