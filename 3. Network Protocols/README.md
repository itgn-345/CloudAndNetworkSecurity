====

Responsible person/main contact: Niklas Saari, Asad Hasan & Lauri Suutari

## Preliminary tasks & prerequisites

This is the third lab in the series with the theme of Network Protocols. 
You should return the tasks to GitHub.

Make yourself familiar with the following topics:


* **List of networking protocols** - Read about the list of networking protocols for the OSI model on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_network_protocols_(OSI_model))
* **20 common networking protocols** - Article presenting 20 common networking protocols [here](https://medium.com/@rajeshmamuddu/20-different-network-protocols-commonly-used-in-networking-e98cab90d18d)
* **OSI Model** - What is the OSI Model on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
* **curl** - Useful curl tutorial [here](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/curl-command)
* Especially, [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is the topic of this week!

TLS protocol from a cryptographic perspective is handled in more depth in cryptographic systems and weakness - course.
This time we note the challenges of the practical implementation, which might not be related to cryptography itself.


## Grading

<!-- <details><summary>Details</summary> -->

You are **not required** to do the tasks in order, but if you do the second task, you shouldn't do the task 3 or 4.

As a result, there are two different paths to do the exercises this week.
 * In both cases, you can do the task 1, and then
    * Do task 2 completely and ignore the rest. With very good implementation you might get even more than 7 points.
    *This task will give the most points on the course and can compensate for other weeks*.
    * Or, do the tasks 3 and 4, but not that many points are available. Task 2 covers also the topics of tasks 3 and 4.



Task #|Points|Description|Tools
-----|:---:|-----------|-----
Task 1 | 1 | HTTP request smuggling | Wireshark, curl, python, flask
Task 2 | 7 | Implementing TLS 1.3 client from scratch | Rust or programming language of your choice, Wireshark, libFuzzer, libAFL
Task 3 | 1 | Fuzz testing exising network protocol (TLS library, Wireshark) (alternative to task 2 with less points) | AFL++, radamsa, other fuzzing tools
Task 4 | 1-2 | TLS certificate validation | certmitm, mitmproxy, Wireshark


Total points accumulated by doing the exercises reflect the overall grade. You can acquire up to 7 points from the whole exercise (Combination of Task 1 and Task 2).

## Background

This weekâ€™s theme is networking protocols.

Tasks are designed to be done using the course's provided virtual machine. **TODO**

Networking protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication between devices in a computer network. These protocols define how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and interpreted across the network. They facilitate the exchange of information between devices, ensuring compatibility and interoperability.

Key aspects of networking protocols include:

1) Addressing: Protocols define how devices are identified and addressed on the network. This includes assigning unique addresses, such as IP addresses, to devices to enable communication.

2) Routing: Protocols determine how data packets are routed from a source to a destination across the network. This involves selecting the best path for data transmission and managing network congestion.

3) Error Handling: Protocols include mechanisms for detecting and correcting errors that may occur during data transmission. This ensures reliable communication between devices.

4) Security: Many protocols incorporate security features to protect data from unauthorized access, interception, or tampering. This includes encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms.

Some common examples of networking protcols include: Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

## Task 1

### HTTP request smuggling

HTTP Request Smuggling is a technique used to manipulate the interpretation of HTTP requests by exploiting inconsistencies in the way front-end and back-end servers or proxies handle requests. By carefully crafting malicious requests, an attacker can cause the front-end and back-end servers to interpret the request differently, leading to various security vulnerabilities such as cache poisoning, session fixation, and bypassing security controls. Read more about this technique on [Port Swigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling)

### A) How do HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise? What's the difference between CL.TE, TE.CL, and TE.TE techniques 

Your first task is to study HTTP request smuggling and write a detailed paragraph about how HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise and differences between CL.TE, TE.CL, and TE.TE HTTP request smuggling techniques. Also, answer the following sub-question

**In which version of HTTP is this vulnerability present? Why is it present in this specific HTTP version? How is the mechanism different?**

Useful resources: [link 1](https://paper.seebug.org/1049/) [research article](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2022/3121177/)

### B) Setup webserver and capture HTTP traffic associated with the website using Wireshark

A local website to demonstrate this request smuggling technique has been setup. Download the zip file from [here](https://a3s.fi/swift/v1/AUTH_d797295bcbc24cec98686c41a8e16ef5/CloudAndNetworkSecurity/http_website.zip) 

```
### Instructions to setup web-server ###
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python
sudo pip install Flask

# Navigate to folder http_website/app.py
# Use python command to run the webserver. Make sure you have python and flask installed
python app.py
```

Website uses a front-end reverse proxy server and a back-end server to handle requests.
Website has two paths accessible at the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1 and port 5000:
1. /home
2. /admin

For example, to access home path, you would enter http://127.0.0.1:5000/home in your browser

Figure below shows website architecture. 

![image](https://github.com/ouspg/CloudAndNetworkSecurity/assets/113350302/6ecbd9ec-1183-4707-b051-cf662ad9dd65)

As a next step, start wireshark and set it to capture traffic on loopback interface. Run the website and capture packets

**Add screenshot of successfully traversing /admin path on the website**

**Study HTTP packets registered when you access /home and /admin paths on the website. Add screenshots**

**What are the most important headers in your HTTP packets. Explain your reasoning**

In the next part, you'll perform an HTTP request smuggling attack. For this you need to understand the most important headers in the HTTP packet.



### C) Craft a custom HTTP packet that performs request smuggling using curl tool with TE.CL technique.

### Using HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security for TE.CL website configuration

To simulate the scenario where the front-end reverse proxy interprets the request differently from the back-end server, we can use a combination of Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers in a single packet using curl command. The aim is to trick the front-end reverse proxy into treating the request based on "Transfer-Encoding" header while the back-end server processes the request based on "Content-Length" header. For example, consider following HTTP packet:

```
POST /home HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

a
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 0

0

```
If you craft and send a packet like this to the webserver, the front-end server sees "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" indicating that the request body is sent in a series of chunks. However, the Content-Length header contradicts this, suggesting a fixed content length of 10 bytes. The front-end server is now confused and prioritizes one header over the other to handle the request based on its specific configuration. Current front-end configuration prioritizes "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header and only parses the POST /home request.

The back-end server will also parse the request headers and see both Transfer-Encoding: chunked and Content-Length headers. Similar to the front-end server, it may need to decide how to handle the conflicting headers. Since, it's configured to prioritize "Content-Length" header, it will receive the POST request with the body 'a' (sent in a single chunk) and process it accordingly. After processing the POST request, the back-end server will see the remaining part of the request, which is the GET request to /admin with an empty body. This will return two responses using just one POST /home request exploiting the inherent TE.CL configuration vulnerability in the website.

Why it happens? The back-end server sees one request for /home and one request for /admin. It assumes (as always) that the requests have passed through the front-end controls (who interpreted request as only one request to /home), and so grants access to the /admin. [A similar example](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting) can be studied from PortSwigger.

In this part, you'll demonstrate a similar smuggled request exploiting the TE.CL vulnerability. 

**Craft a curl command which creates a custom HTTP packet and send it to the website to smuggle the /admin webpage HTML body**

    1.) The first part of the command initiates a POST request to the /home endpoint with the character 'a' as the payload. 
        This request is formatted to include both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding: chunked headers.
    2.) The second part of the command initiates a GET request to the /admin endpoint with an empty body. 
        This request also includes the Content-Length: 0 header.
    By combining these requests in a specific way, we aim to exploit differences in how the front-end reverse proxy and the 
    back-end server interpret and process the request. This discrepancy can lead to security vulnerabilities, allowing attackers 
    to bypass access controls or gain access to restricted resources.


**Command used**

**Screenshot of result**

>[!TIP]
> When using curl to make HTTP requests, you can change the request method using the -X flag followed by the desired HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). When changing the request method with -X, it's important to also include the -i flag to view the response headers. This allows you to verify that the server responds as expected to the specified request method. Using -X and -i flags together provides visibility into how the server responds to different request methods, which is essential for debugging and testing purposes.

## Task 2: Implementing TLS 1.3 client from scratch (up to 6 points)

> [!Note]
> You can complete this task in pairs! **But not in larger groups**. Remember to mention your pair. The workload assumes that you have friendly LLMs available, such as ChatGPT, [Phind](https://www.phind.com) or [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart).

> [!Note]
> You can work on this task until the end of the course, if you want to, but it is recommended to do in time.

> You can fully focus on this task to get up to 6 points by doing it carefully. But be warned, getting a maximum grade requires a lot of work.

> If you want to skip the coding, you have another path with similar goal. You can fuzz test existing TLS library and get up to 1 points. Additionally, there is an additional certificate validation task which replaces the same part of this task. As result, this offers two points.


Implementing network protocols correctly can be *hard*. They are typically complex and work in a binary, non-text format.
This is because of the performance reasons, error correction and the minimized addition of overhead to the total bandwidth usage. They must follow strict standards to be compatible with different hardware and software systems.
Protocols must be designed to handle arbitrary data and then parse and process them correctly while doing it fast. They must be fault-tolerant if they encounter incorrect data.

> A huge part from the all security problems are related to faulty implementations of these protocols, or incorrect use of them.

If we look at the network OSI model structure, we can see many different protocols on different layers for different purposes. 
In the following example graph, the application is transmitting ASN.1 binary encoded data as TLS 1.3 encrypted over TCP/IP protocol. 

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Application Layer] -->|"Data Encoding (ASN.1 binary)"| B[Presentation Layer]
    B -->|TLS 1.3| C["Session Layer"]
    C -->|TCP/IP| D[Transport Layer]
    D --> E[Network Layer]
    E --> F[Data Link Layer]
    F --> G[Physical Layer]
```

All of the protocols are complex, but they share similar efficiency and robustness requirements while having different goals. 
 
 * ASN.1 encodes the application-specific data compactly to be suitable for the usage and parsing of other applications. (Compare it to more efficient  JSON)
 * TLS 1.3. encrypts the session data so that it cannot be eavesdropped on or modified, while also giving sufficient guarantees that the data goes to the intended party.
 * TCP/IP carries the data to the destination over some network in an IP address space with some reliability guarantees.


To demonstrate the complexity and process of doing them correctly and *maybe even more securely*, we will implement the handshake part of the TLS 1.3 protocol standard as a minimal client.

This should also make you more familiar with what it takes to transmit encrypted data over an insecure line so that it might even go to the correct destination, efficiently with binary protocols.

> [!Important]
> **This is for educational purposes only. In general, you should not write your TLS library yourself on byte level.**

### TLS 1.3 Handshake Protocol

* [RFC 8446](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446)
    * Provided ASN.1 notations about data structures are super useful when implementing the client. Especially, if one consults a friendly LLM. *The Rust starter project has already most of them.*
    * You *will need to* read this standard to understand the protocol.

* Transport Layer Security [in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)


A small background [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3) about the major changes compared to previous versions.

In conclusion, TLS 1.3 is much simpler compared to previous versions and supports only a limited amount of cipher suites (only the strong ones).

For the purpose of this task, it should be doable, and can give us a glance at what protocols could be!

To get a good overview of the standard and the handshake process at the byte level, check [https://tls13.xargs.org](https://tls13.xargs.org).
The provided Rust project will help the implementation of other programming languages too, if you decide so. 

During the handshake, both the client and server agree on the cipher suite as follows.

* Key exchange mechanism (e.g., ECDHE for elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman ephemeral)
* Signature algorithm (e.g., RSA, ECDSA)
* Symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
* The hash function for message authentication and PRFs (e.g., SHA-256)

The priority and availability of the cipher suites are pre-defined for the task.

### Implementation requirements (3p)

> [!Important]
> You should implement *a client*, with minimal working features to complete TLS 1.3 handshake, while also noting the error handling. Or more, if you decide so, to replace other tasks from this week.

Minimal TLS client implementation includes the completion of the handshake process with the following features:
  * Key exchange with X25519 and signatures with EdDSA (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519 and Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm based on the same curve).
  * ChaCha20-Poly1305 as a symmetric algorithm.
  * The client should be able to handle the processing of arbitrary input data from the TCP stream. We get some guarantees with fuzz testing which provides one additional point.
  *  In TLS 1.3, the use of certain extensions is mandatory
  * Mandatory extensions as specified [here.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#section-9.2) The sample Rust project has most of them implemented with `as_bytes` mapper. The extensions required are
    * Supported Versions (describes the used TLS version)
    * Server Name (What is the DNS of the server we want to connect)
    * Signature Algorithms (What method to use to sign the data)
    * Supported Groups (Key negotiation algorithm)
    * Key Share (Public keys)
  * At least `cloudflare.com` supports the above ciphers for testing purposes.
  * You can and *should* use Wireshark to debug your implementation.

Note that the protocol follows mostly the *tag-length-value* principle. 
There can be constraints for the size of the tag or length, and **this defines how many bytes the tag or length can take**, while the length itself then defines the number of subsequent bytes.

The sample project provides the *encoding* part for the above, but not the *decoding* part. Decoding means mapping arbitrary binary data to correct data structures. This is the part where the typical security problems arise and you should focus on.

### Certificate validation (1p)

> "The most dangerous code in the world: validating SSL certificates in non-browser
software." [Georgiev, Martin, et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2382196.2382204)

To make sure that you are messaging with the claimed entity, you need to validate certificates.

You can additionally do a proper client-side certificate validation to get an additional point. In practice, this means: 
  * Verify that the server-provided certificate is authentic and issued by a trusted entity (Certificate Authority, CA). Check the certificate chain.
  * Verify that this certificate belongs to the domain you are connecting to.
  * Verify that the certificate has not expired.
  * Verify that this certificate is not revoked. (OPTIONAL, can give additional points)


This will replace the final task.

### The decryption of the application data content (1p)

You can get **one point** for showcasing the decrypted TLS 1.3 application data from the server that supports this client.
To demonstrate this, you will send TLS 1.3 encrypted application data, for example to `cloudflare.com`. The application data contains an HTTP GET request to path `/robots.txt`.

```http
GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: cloudflare.com
Connection: close
```


Typically, this means sending the following raw string as application data payload in the TLS record over TCP:

```text
GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: cloudflare.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n
```

The server will then send the data in response, wrapped in the TLS record again.


> You are alloved to consult a friendly LLM, but note that the code it provides might not be correct and can include bugs! You are not allowed to directly copy-paste some existing implementation, even though the LLM is likely providing code samples based on those.




**You will get one bonus point for doing the work with *Rust*; this encourages the usage of memory-safe language, which can produce native performance and it enforces other design choices that could reduce the bugs in the software.**

> [!Note]
> *If you end up fighting with the Rust compiler, you are just preventing bugs, which would have resulted into software runtime with another programming language!*

Overall grading table for this task:

Description |Points|
-----|:---:|
Use of Rust with sufficient implementation | 1 |
Minimal handshake implementation from above | 3 |
Fuzz testing the implementation with the help of fuzzing libraries | 1+ |
Proper client-side certificate validation | 1+ |
Decrypt application content from TLS 1.3 server with your client | 1 |


### Language list that you should consider

You must implement it with a strongly typed programming language of your choice.
We hope that you do it with Rust and the provided sample project. It has many things done already and will introduce you to some modern tooling.

Generally, if you want to do something efficiently, you should pick a lower-level programming language.
Typically, this has meant either the use of C or C++.
However, with great power comes a great responsibility and the history is filled with memory safety issues. Correct programming is hard and making difficult protocols makes it even harder. 

1. Rust (1 bonus point from sufficient implementation, and we offer [a starter project](rust_example), with a lot of working functionality, to compensate for the initial difficulty of the language.)
2. Other strongly typed memory-safe languages (typically less efficient because of the dynamic memory management) (Swift ([ARC-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Reference_Counting)), Go, Java, C#, etc.)
3. Programming C++ with [modern features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp?view=msvc-170) (Unique pointers etc.), [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), or other native languages with some memory safety properties. High performance and control-level with some risk of memory issues.
4. Weakly typed scripting languages (Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript) or risky languages, C, basic C++, and Assembly, **are not allowed this time**. While the scripting languages can provide memory-safe code, they are typically inefficient, and increase the likelihood of other bugs as a result of weak types. 


If you decide to use C++, **you must use modern pointers**. We don't like memory bugs.
The use of modern pointers does not guarantee it, but they reduce them significantly.
They apply a similar ownership principle as the Rust does for every data object by default.

### Software dependency requirements

You are allowed to use dependencies other than the programming language's standard library as follows if they are not included in the standard library:
 * To generate cryptographically secure random bits. (e.g. [rand](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/) crate in Rust)
 * To derive the public key from the private key in X25519 protocol (e.g. [curve25519-dalek ](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/tree/main/x25519-dalek) crate in Rust) and calculate the shared secret.
 * For parsing the certificates (typically means ASN.1 DER encoding), e.g. [rasn](https://github.com/librasn/rasn) crate in Rust. 
 * To verify the certificate chain
 * For ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption and EdDSA signatures

 Other dependencies **are not allowed**.

### Debugging tips for the handshake protocol

You can use `openssl` to form a TLS connection with specific parameters.
This can help us to understand, what the correct process looks like, on top of the other material.
Let's say, we want to force TLS 1.3 version and get the handshake data. We can use the following command:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 -tls1_3 -ciphersuites TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 -msg -tlsextdebug
```

However, not all the data is well segmented.
The content of `ClientHello` is a single hex dump, and that does not help us to see, for example, what extensions our client sets by default.

For that, Wireshark is very useful. It can format every byte from the TLS handshake protocol and can help us to get, for example, test data from known functioning TLS libraries, or **it can help us to understand what goes wrong with our own TLS implementation**.

Here is an example look for TLS 1.3 ClientHello structure for `github.com` in Wireshark:

```text

Wireshark is capable of showing what specific part from the `ClientHello` structure was invalid.

## Task 3



---
## Task 4 TLS certificate validation
> [!Note]
> If you completed the client-side implementation to a sufficient level in task 2, you do not need to complete this task to receive full credits for this weeks laboratory.

Certificate validation is an ongoing problem with TLS implementations, lots of libraries implement this, but the issue is that certificate validation is usually optional for the client in TLS and the configuration of certificate validation in different TLS libraries can be very difficult. When validating certificates, it should be checked who has issued the certificate, to whom is it issued to and that the certificate has been properly signed. Especially self signed certificates should not just be accepted without validation as these can be easily created on the go. A good example of improper certificate validations are [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) and [WolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/) libraries where the validation isn't even enabled by default.

![image](https://github.com/ouspg/CloudAndNetworkSecurity/assets/55877405/94e5b180-9341-4ce4-b887-4e4ecf694aa2)


To complete this task you should understand how TLS works and how the certificates are (or aren't) validated on the server side. The following links contain sufficient information to get started with this task:
* [DEF CON 31 - certmitm Automatic Exploitation of TLS Certificate Validation Vulns - Aapo Oksman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_l2q_Gyqfo)
* [Presentation slides of certmitm](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2031/DEF%20CON%2031%20presentations/Aapo%20Oksman%20-%20certmitm%20automatic%20exploitation%20of%20TLS%20certificate%20validation%20vulnerabilities.pdf)
* [certmitm demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0HeTBfKLhQ)

### Local Certificate Validation (1p) 

You are free to use **tools of your choice** to complete this task, however we highly suggest getting started with Aapo Oksman's [certmitm](https://github.com/aapooksman/certmitm) tool. For full credit you should demonstrate the usage of your tool of choice on **multiple different application types** such as; mobile applications, web applications, games and/or other software to see if they are implementing certificate validation properly.

You can use any machine for this task, but it is suggested to run it on a VM

> [!Warning]
> Although this isnt illegal as you are just finding out potential vulnerabilities, not exploiting them, you shouldn't test this on Riot Games applications. As per [Aapo Oksman's iOS demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWidokJKuUc), their response to his vulnerability findings was "in theory it may be possible (to exploit this), but we would detect it and kick you or mark it as suspicious for investigation...this finding will not be fixed since there is compensathing controls.". 

The overall process should look like the following:
* Create a self-signed certificate and download the course provided certificate and move them to certmitm/real_certs/
* Create a second user
* Create an iptables rules to mark packets generated by the ID of second user
* Redirect TCP packets generated by others users destined to port 443 into port 9900
* Run certmitm on the second user
* Switch to another user and install packages, run softwares, browse internet and analyze the results generated by certmitm, if you do manage to get red information from certmitm these could be potential vulnerabilities

If successful certmitm should start producing data like the following:

> In situations where you dont seem to be able to install/run software the best thing you can do is retrying again!

### WLAN certificate Validation (1p)
On this task you will be provided a Raspberry Pi, which you are to set up to work as a Wi-Fi hotspot for other devices and then use certmitm to analyze applications on your device. The following video demonstrates this task:
* [Exploiting insecure Certificate Validation in iOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWidokJKuUc)

Turning your Raspberry Pi into a Wi-Fi hotspot involves; flashing the Raspberry PI with a fresh OS (setup SSH here), installing necessary updates and packages, configuring the device to work as an access point for your other external device, verifying the connection and that WLAN interface is up.

After this you should git clone/copy (scp) the [certmitm](https://github.com/aapooksman/certmitm) into the Raspberry Pi machine (and the certificates as in the previous task), update the pyOpenSSL package, create a rule that preroutes the tcp traffic on the WLAN interface on ports 443 and redirects them to port 9900 and then setup certmitm to listen to this port like in the Local Certificate Validation task. If successful and your phone is able to connect to the internet via the Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi then you should start getting data from certmitm and analyze these results.

The following image shows the high level idea in this task:
