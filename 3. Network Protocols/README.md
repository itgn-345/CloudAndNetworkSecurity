## About the lab

* This document contains task descriptions and theory for the third cloud and network security lab. If there are any differences between the return template and this file, consider this to be the up-to-date document.
* **You are encouraged to use your own computer or virtual machine if you want.** TODO ----------------------- TODO
* __Upper scores for this assignment require that all previous tasks in this assignment have been done as well__, so e.g. in order to get the third point you will have to complete tasks 1, 2 & 3.
* Check the deadline from Moodle and __remember that you have to return your name (and possibly people you worked together with) and GitHub repository information to Moodle before the deadline.__


## Background

This weekâ€™s theme is networking protocols.

Tasks are designed to be done using course's provided virtual machine. **TODO**

Networking protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication between devices in a computer network. These protocols define how data is formatted, transmitted, received, and interpreted across the network. They facilitate the exchange of information between devices, ensuring compatibility and interoperability.

Key aspects of networking protocols include:

1) Addressing: Protocols define how devices are identified and addressed on the network. This includes assigning unique addresses, such as IP addresses, to devices to enable communication.

2) Routing: Protocols determine how data packets are routed from a source to a destination across the network. This involves selecting the best path for data transmission and managing network congestion.

3) Error Handling: Protocols include mechanisms for detecting and correcting errors that may occur during data transmission. This ensures reliable communication between devices.

4) Security: Many protocols incorporate security features to protect data from unauthorized access, interception, or tampering. This includes encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms.

Some common examples of networking protcols include: Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

## Task 1

### HTTP request smuggling

Before, you can start doing the lab tasks for points, you need to spawn your virtual network infrastructure. For this, you require latest terraform configurations and pfsense image
containing new network. This is done for you already. All you have to do is clone the right terraform configurations and place the right VM images. Afterwards, you can initialize terraform as was in the first lab

For simplicity, follow the three steps guide below:

**1) Fetch the new_network setup branch**

Fetch the lab2 branch and checkout to it.
```
git fetch origin lab2
git checkout lab2
```

**2) Download and place relevant images into _network_sec_platform/images_ folder**

There are images that you need to download and place into the following directory _**network_sec_platform/images**_

If you completed lab 1, you can use the same kali and ubuntu images and download only the latest pfsense image named _**pfsense_x.qcow2**_

Image name|Image size|Download Link
:-:|:-:|:-:
Kali linux | 14.6 gb | [kali download](https://a3s.fi/swift/v1/AUTH_d797295bcbc24cec98686c41a8e16ef5/CloudAndNetworkSecurity/kali-linux-2023.4-qemu-amd64.zip)
Ubuntu server | 1.8 gb | [server download](https://a3s.fi/swift/v1/AUTH_d797295bcbc24cec98686c41a8e16ef5/CloudAndNetworkSecurity/ubuntu_server.qcow2)
pfSense (lab 2) | 1 gb | [pfsense download](https://a3s.fi/swift/v1/AUTH_d797295bcbc24cec98686c41a8e16ef5/CloudAndNetworkSecurity/pfsense_x.qcow2)

**3) Spawn your network**

Go-to network_sec_platform directory and use following commands to spawn the network

```
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform apply
```
If done correctly, there should be 12 resources spawned.

```
#Access virtual resources by typing
virt-manager
```
See machine's login info below

## Task 2: Implementing TLS 1.3 handshake "securely" (up to 4 points or even more)

> You can fully focus on this task to get up to 4 points by doing it carefully.

> If you want to skip the coding, you can fuzz test existing TLS library and get up to 1 points.


Implementing network protocols correctly can be *hard*. They are typically complex and work in a binary, non-text format.
This is because of the performance reasons, error correction and the minimized addition of overhead to the total bandwidth usage. They must follow strict standards to be compatible with different hardware and software systems.
Protocols must be designed to handle arbitrary data and then parse and process them correctly while doing it fast. They must be fault-tolerant if they encounter incorrect data.

If we look at the network OSI model structure, we can see many different protocols on different layers for different purposes. 
In the following example graph, the application is transmitting ASN.1 binary encoded data as TLS 1.3 encrypted over TCP/IP protocol. 

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Application Layer] -->|"Data Encoding (ASN.1 binary)"| B[Presentation Layer]
    B -->|TLS 1.3| C["Session Layer"]
    C -->|TCP/IP| D[Transport Layer]
    D --> E[Network Layer]
    E --> F[Data Link Layer]
    F --> G[Physical Layer]
```

All of the protocols are complex, but they share similar problems while having different goals. 
 
 * ASN.1 encodes the application-specific data compactly to be suitable for the usage and parsing of other applications. (Compare it to more efficient  JSON)
 * TLS 1.3. encrypts the session data so that it cannot be eavesdropped on or modified, while also giving some guarantees that the data goes to the intended party.
 * TCP/IP carries the data to the destination over some network in an IP address space with some reliability guarantees.


To demonstrate the complexity and process of doing them correctly and *maybe more securely*, we will implement one protocol on our own. 
The protocol will be the handshake part of the TLS 1.3 protocol standard, and we will make a minimal client.
This should also make you more familiar with what it takes to transmit encrypted data over an insecure line so that it might even go to the correct destination, efficiently with binary format.

### TLS 1.3

* [RFC 8446 (Section 4. about handshake)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446)
    * Provided ASN.1 notations about data structures are super useful when implementing the client. Especially, if one consults a friendly LLM.

A small background [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3) about the major changes compared to previous versions.

In conclusion, TLS 1.3 is much simpler compared to previous versions and supports only a limited amount of cipher suites (only the strong ones).

For the purpose of this task, it should be doable, and can give us a glance at what protocols could be!


Your main guide source should be [https://tls13.xargs.org](https://tls13.xargs.org), (but still, don't just copy the code from there).

### Implementation requirements

> [!Important]
> You should implement *a client*, with minimal working features to complete TLS 1.3 handshake, while also noting the error handling. 

> You are alloved to consult a friendly LLM, but note that the code it provides might not be correct and can include bugs! You are not allowed to directly copy-paste some existing implementation, even though the LLM is likely providing code samples based on those.


You must implement it with a strongly typed programming language of your choice.

Generally, if you want to do something efficiently, you should pick a lower-level programming language.
Typically, this has meant either the use of C or C++.
However, with great power comes a great responsibility and the history is filled with memory safety issues. Correct programming is hard and making difficult protocols makes it even harder. 

You will get one bonus point for doing the work with *Rust*; this encourages the usage of memory-safe language, which can produce native performance and other design choices that could reduce the bugs in the software.

*If you end up fighting with the Rust compiler, you are just preventing bugs, which would have resulted into software runtime with another programming language.*

### Language list that you should consider

1. Rust (1 bonus point from sufficient implementation)
2. Other strongly typed memory-safe languages (typically less efficient because of the dynamic memory management) (Swift ([ARC-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Reference_Counting)), Go, Java, C#, etc.)
3. Programming C++ with [modern features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/welcome-back-to-cpp-modern-cpp?view=msvc-170) (Unique pointers etc.), [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), or other native languages with some memory safety properties. High performance with some risk of memory issues.
4. Weakly typed scripting languages (Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript) or risky languages, C, basic C++, Assembly, **are not recommended this time**. While the scripting languages can provide memory-safe code, they are typically inefficient, and increase the likelihood of other bugs as a result of weak types.
